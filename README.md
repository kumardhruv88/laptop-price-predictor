## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Laptop specifications and prices dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.  
3. **Model Training** – Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
4. **Evaluation** – Compare models using R², RMSE, and MAE metrics.  
5. **Deployment** – Streamlit app lets users input laptop specs and get predicted price.

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Achieved accurate predictions on unseen test data.  
- Identified important features affecting laptop price (e.g., brand, RAM, GPU).  
- Streamlit app makes the solution accessible to non-technical users.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of **machine learning regression models**.  
- Strong understanding of **feature engineering and preprocessing**.  
- Built an **end-to-end ML pipeline** from data cleaning to deployment.  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **deep learning models** for better predictions.  
- Expand dataset with more real-world laptop listings.  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, GCP)** for public access.
